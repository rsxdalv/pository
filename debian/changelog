pository (0.1.6) stable; urgency=medium

  * Fix version display: bump frontend/package.json to 0.1.6 so postinst
    rebuild bakes the correct version string into the Next.js static build.
    Previous 0.1.5 deploy left frontend title showing v0.1.4 because apt
    skipped reinstall of an already-installed 0.1.5 package.

pository (0.1.5) stable; urgency=medium

  * Fix frontend build: remove orphaned duplicate component body from
    packages.tsx that caused Turbopack "Return statement is not allowed here"
    errors, breaking the frontend build entirely.
  * Fix postinst: clean node_modules and .next before rebuilding to avoid
    stale cache issues; force NODE_ENV=development so devDependencies
    (tailwindcss, typescript, etc.) are installed during package setup.

pository (0.1.4) stable; urgency=medium

  * Release: record package.json bump to 0.1.4 and update frontend
    dashboard title to display the current version (Pository - v0.1.4).

pository (0.1.3) stable; urgency=medium

  * Self-healing metadata: on service startup the index is automatically
    repaired by reading control fields from .deb files for any packages
    that were stored before upload-time metadata extraction was implemented.
    No manual backfill scripts are needed.
  * Upload fallback: when the built-in control parser fails (e.g. for
    xz/zstd-compressed control archives), dpkg-deb is used to extract
    metadata so uploads always store complete control fields.
  * Additional relationship fields (Pre-Depends, Suggests, Conflicts,
    Breaks, Replaces, Provides) are now extracted and served in the
    Packages index, covering all apt VersionHash-relevant fields.

pository (0.1.2) stable; urgency=medium

  * Fix: Architecture:all packages are now served from binary-{arch}/Packages
    instead of a separate binary-all/Packages index, matching how official
    Ubuntu/Debian mirrors work.  apt only merges dpkg/status records with
    entries from the native-arch Packages file; binary-all/Packages entries
    were never merged, keeping installed arch:all packages perpetually
    "upgradeable".
  * Fix: Release file Codename is now unique per repo+distribution pairing
    (pository-<repo>-<distribution>) to prevent apt from treating two
    different Pository repos as the same source.
  * Fix: Real package metadata (description, maintainer, depends, homepage,
    section, priority) is now extracted from the deb's control file at upload
    time instead of using synthetic placeholder values.  Mismatched description
    text caused apt to compute a different Description-md5, creating duplicate
    version objects.
  * Fix: Description continuation lines are normalised to a single leading
    space as required by the Packages file format.
  * Fix: Description-md5 field is now included in generated Packages files.
  * Fix: Installed-Size is emitted in the Packages index only when the deb's
    own control file carries the field.  A synthetic Installed-Size value
    diverged from what dpkg records in its status database, causing a
    VersionHash mismatch and perpetual "upgradeable" state.
  * Fix: Multi-Arch is emitted in the Packages index only when the deb's own
    control file explicitly declares it.  Synthesising Multi-Arch: foreign for
    arch:all packages caused a similar VersionHash mismatch for debs that do
    not carry the field.
  * Feature: Package list UI now groups versions by package name.  Each package
    appears as a single row showing the latest version; older versions can be
    expanded via an inline toggle.

pository (0.1.1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Fix: Architecture:all packages were indexed in both binary-amd64/Packages
    and binary-all/Packages, causing apt to report every arch-independent
    package as perpetually upgradeable (closes #5).
    Architecture:all packages are now indexed exclusively in binary-all/Packages
    so that apt sees each package from exactly one source.
