pository (0.1.1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Fix: Architecture:all packages were indexed in both binary-amd64/Packages
    and binary-all/Packages, causing apt to report every arch-independent
    package as perpetually upgradeable (closes #5).
    Architecture:all packages are now indexed exclusively in binary-all/Packages
    so that apt sees each package from exactly one source.
